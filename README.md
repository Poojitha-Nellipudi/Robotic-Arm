# Robotic-Arm
Robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom was designed, developed and fabricated using 3D printer. Forward and inverse kinematic models were developed to control the position of the robotic arm, whereas the orientation of the robotic arm was controlled by servo motors with arduino and MATLAB.
